\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
In the vast realm of biological sciences, understanding the complex interplay of various phenomena is a formidable challenge. Nature's intricacies often defy direct observation and experimentation, necessitating the development of powerful tools that can unravel its hidden patterns. Enter mathematical models, a transformative approach that harnesses the language of mathematics to dissect, analyze, and predict the behavior of biological systems. These models serve as indispensable bridges between theoretical abstractions and empirical realities, enabling scientists to gain deeper insights into the fundamental principles that govern living organisms. By quantifying and formalizing biological processes, mathematical models offer a systematic framework to study intricate dynamics, investigate the consequences of different hypotheses, and guide experimental design.

There have been a plethora of models created to analyze the dynamics of such ecosystems. There are models which considers two species~\cite{GHOSH2017110, CHEN20122790, YU2012208167, HUANG2006672, AZIZALAOUI20031069, XIAO200614, SEN201212, CANTRELL2001206, CHEN20092905, CHEN2010246, KAR2005681, CHATTOPADHYAY1996287, KAR2003125}, three species~\cite{GAKKHAR201654, PANJA2022100153, MENG2014810, ALIDOUSTI2020109688, PEET2005491, SARWARDI2012133, PRIYADARSHI20133202, GAKKHAR2005105, GAKKHAR2007808, Mukherjee2013, DHAKNEMUNDE2012, CHATTOPADHYAY200345, PANJAMONDAL2015, PANJA2017389, KHAJANCHI2017193, JANA2017350} and four species~\cite{JANA2021100942}. Some of these models incorporate a functional response in their model, which include the Beddington–DeAngelis functional response~\cite{CANTRELL2001206}, the Crowley–Martin type functional response~\cite{MENG2014810}, the Holling-type I functional response~\cite{JANA2021100942, Mukherjee2013, CHATTOPADHYAY200345}, the Holling-type II functional response~\cite{GAKKHAR201654, PANJA2022100153, JANA2021100942, GHOSH2017110, YU2012208167, HUANG2006672, AZIZALAOUI20031069, CHEN2010246, SARWARDI2012133, PRIYADARSHI20133202, GAKKHAR2005105, GAKKHAR2007808, Mukherjee2013, CHATTOPADHYAY200345, PANJAMONDAL2015, JANA2017350}, the Holling-type III functional response~\cite{CHATTOPADHYAY200345}, the Leslie-Gower functional response~\cite{YU2012208167, AZIZALAOUI20031069, PRIYADARSHI20133202}, the Monod-Haldane type functional response~\cite{ALIDOUSTI2020109688}, and the Ratio-dependent functional response~\cite{XIAO200614, SEN201212, CANTRELL2001206, KHAJANCHI2017193}. Some models consider prey refuge~\cite{GAKKHAR201654, PANJA2022100153, GHOSH2017110, CHEN20122790, HUANG2006672, CHEN20092905, CHEN2010246, KAR2005681, SARWARDI2012133, Mukherjee2013, KHAJANCHI2017193, JANA2017350}, harvesting~\cite{XIAO200614, KAR2003125, PANJA2017389}, and the Allee effect~\cite{SEN201212}.

In this paper, we will consider a biological system that involves three species with each pairing of species have a unique interaction. In particular, we will study an ecosystem which involves predation, non-linear mutualism, and amensalism. The pairing of species that are in a predation interaction incorporates the Holling type II functional response and refuge into consideration. One example of an ecosystem that has these three interactions is an ecosystem which contains lions, meerkats, and forked-tailed drongos. The predation interaction involves the lions and meerkats where lions would prey on the meerkats. The mutualism interaction involves the meerkats and the forked-tailed drongos where if the lions would be nearby trying to eat the meerkats, the forked-tailed drongos would signal the meerkats via a warning cry to let them know that a predator is nearby. Also, if a meerkat has dug up some food, the forked-tailed drongos would fly down and take it from the meerkats. Finally, the amensalism interaction involves the lions and the forked-tailed drongos where as a result of the meerkats being preyed on, the forked-tailed drongos have less food available to gather.
