\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
In the vast realm of biological sciences, understanding the complex interplay of various phenomena is a formidable challenge. Nature's intricacies often defy direct observation and experimentation, necessitating the development of powerful tools that can unravel its hidden patterns. Enter mathematical models, a transformative approach that harnesses the language of mathematics to dissect, analyze, and predict the behavior of biological systems. These models serve as indispensable bridges between theoretical abstractions and empirical realities, enabling scientists to gain deeper insights into the fundamental principles that govern living organisms. By quantifying and formalizing biological processes, mathematical models offer a systematic framework to study intricate dynamics, investigate the consequences of different hypotheses, and guide experimental design. %This paper delves into the multifaceted world of mathematical modeling in biology, shedding light on its significance, challenges, and transformative potential in illuminating the mysteries of life itself.

% In this field, the most common system to model are models which involve two species. 

% While the most common system to model are models which inviolve two species, there are models that extend the idea of modeling two species to three species.

% Some instances of mathematical modeling being used in ecological systems are the model proposed by Lotka and Volterra~\cite{book:9781461416852}, Rosenzweig-MacArthur~\cite{article:10.1086/282272}, and Hassell~\cite{book:9780691209968}. All of which involved two species. However, mathematical modeling is not limited to modeling two species in an ecological system. There have been mathematical models proposed by authors who consider a system of three species~\cite{article:1476-945X,article:0025-5564,doi:10.1080/02286203.2020.1839168}.

% \section{Summary of paper}
In this paper, we will consider a biological system that involves three species with each pairing of species have an unique interaction. In particular, we will study an ecosystem which involves predation, non-linear mutualism, and amensalism. The pairing of species that are in a predation interaction incorporrates the Holling type II functional response and refuge into consideration.
