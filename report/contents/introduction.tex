\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

In biology, there are many ecological systems that can be analyzed through mathematical modeling. Through mathematical modeling, one can determine the behavior of a complex ecological system. Some instances of mathematical modeling being used in ecological systems are the model proposed by Lotka and Volterra~\cite{brauer_castillo-ch√°vez_2012}, Rosenzweig-MacArthur~\cite{doi:10.1086/282272}, and Hassell~\cite{hassell2020dynamics}. All of which involved two species. However, mathematical modeling is not limited to modeling two species in an ecological system. There have been mathematical models proposed by authors who consider a system of three species~\cite{JANA2021100942,FREEDMAN1977257,doi:10.1080/02286203.2020.1839168}.
