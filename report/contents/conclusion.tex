\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have constructed a mathematical model that models a three species ecosystem which involves predation, non-linear mutualism, and amensalism.
We have shown that the model is bounded and always yield positive solutions.
We have analytically shown that eight, unique equilibrium points exist and determined the conditions of stability for each equilibrium point.
To further support these results, we have done some numerical simunlations for each stable equilibrium point.
For the interior equilbrium, we have shown the existence of hopf bifurcations for each parameter through numerical simulations.
