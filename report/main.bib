In contrast with other analyses, we consider the effect on the third trophic level by the first-level parameters. The model shows complex, as well as, chaotic oscillations. Bifurcation diagrams show period doubling route to chaos and crises. Also from the forward and backwards sections of the bifurcation diagrams, we find hysteresis. This result implies the coexistence of attractors for the same parameter values. In particular, we consider the coexistence of a chaotic and a P1 attractors. Our results show that the regulation in the food chain is not exclusive to either a food–prey or prey–predator interaction, but to a more subtle food–prey–predator interaction, where, for some parameter values, a food–prey or a prey–predator regulation may dominate the system's dynamics. Finally, we consider the impact of the intraspecies interaction in the overall dynamics of the food chain.}

    abstract = {Gauss's competitive exclusive principle states that two competing species having analogous environment cannot usually occupy the same space at a time but in order to exploit their common environment in a different manner, they can co-exist only when they are active in different times. On the other hand, several studies on predators in various natural and laboratory situations have shown that competitive coexistence can result from predation in a way by resisting any one prey species from becoming sufficiently abundant to outcompete other species such that the predator makes the coexistence possible. It has also been shown that the use of refuges by a fraction of the prey population exerts a stabilizing effect in the interacting population dynamics. Further, the field surveys in the Sundarban mangrove ecosystem reveal that two detritivorous fishes, viz. Liza parsia and Liza tade (prey population) coexist in nature with the presence of the predator fish population, viz. Lates calcarifer by using refuges. In view of such observations in mind, a three-component model consisting of two prey and one predator population is considered in the present investigation with the inclusion of Holling type-II response function incorporating a constant proportion of prey refuge. The essential mathematical features of the present model have been analyzed thoroughly in terms of the local and the global stability and the bifurcations arising in some selected situations as well. The threshold values for some parameters indicating the feasibility and the stability conditions of some equilibria are also determined. The ranges of the significant parameters under which the system admits a Hopf bifurcation are investigated. The explicit formulae for determining the stability, direction and other properties of bifurcating periodic solutions are also derived with the use of both the normal form and the central manifold theory. Numerical illustrations are performed finally in order to validate the applicability of the model under consideration.}

The principle of competitive exclusion holds in such cases. However, numerical simulations exhibit persistence in the presence of periodic solutions in the boundary planes. The system exhibits quasi-periodic behavior in the positive octant. The co-existence in the form of a limit cycle is also possible in some cases.}

Toxin producing phytoplankton (TPP) reduces the grazing pressure of zooplankton. The present note modifies Hastings and Powell model by introducing an extra mortality term in zooplankton population. Our result suggests that chaotic behaviour less likely occurs in a real food chain dynamics.}

    abstract = {In this paper, a three species predator-prey interaction model among Phytoplankton, Zooplankton and Fish has been developed in the presence of toxicant. It is assumed that Phytoplankton grows logistically and its growth rate is affected by toxin release in the environment through different natural and human activities. It is considered that Zooplankton consumes only Phytoplankton. Fish consumes both Phytoplankton as well as Zooplankton. Here, it is also assume that Phytoplankton releases some toxin in the environment which makes some death on Zooplankton. Also, it is considered that toxicant in the environment are increased constantly for different natural and human behavior. Then, different equilibrium points have been determined and the stability of the proposed system has been analyzed around these equilibrium points. Hopf bifurcation analysis has been done with respect to the contact rate between Phytoplankton and Environmental toxin (γ), constant rate of increase of Environmental toxin (A) , depletion rate of environmental toxin (d1), harvesting effort (E) and rate of releasing toxin by Phytoplankton (ρ). From this study, it is seen that these parameters have a big role on the stability of this predator prey system. Finally, some numerical simulation results have been shown to verify our analytical findings.}

    abstract = {Every population should exploit a specially variable and diverse environment so as to increase their Darwinian fitness. Dynamics of any local population depends upon attributes of the local habitat. Although, use of refuge habitat by prey population can reduce their risk of predation, refuge use may also involve cost such as increased interspecific and intraspecific competition within the refuge patch. Surveys in the Sunderban mangrove ecosystem show that two detritivorous prey fishes Liza parsia and Liza tade coexist in nature by using refuges with the presence of the predator fish population Lates calcarifer. In view of such observations in mind, a three component model conceiving of two competing prey and one predator is considered in the present study with the inclusion of Holling type-II response function incorporating a fraction of prey refuge. The geographic position of these refuge patches tend to determine the population of prey residing in these patches which ultimately leads to the interspecific competition inclusion between prey. Here, we have differentiated the geographic position of the refuge patch into five different cases, for example, disjoint refuge patch (no competition between refuge prey population), partially overlapping refuge patch (competition between non-refuge and partially refuge prey population), only one prey refuge patch (competition between one prey population entirely and non-refuge prey population of the other) and common refuge patch (competition between both refuge and non-refuge prey in and out of the common patch). Equilibrium abundance of each population and the stability criterion are absolutely motivated by the interspecific competition strategies by both prey due to their patch selection. Mathematical results and numerical results support these hypothesis.}
