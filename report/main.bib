    abstract = {In this paper, a three species predator–prey model has been proposed incorporating nonlinear Lotka–Volterra competition between two competing species x and y. It is assumed that the growth rate of x increases due to its commensalism on z, but predator z species consumes y species as prey following Holling type II functional response. Moreover the prey refuge behavior has been considered on y species. Positivity and boundedness of solutions are shown analytically. Different equilibrium points are determined and the stability of the system has been checked around these equilibrium points. Hopf bifurcation analysis has been done with respect to the nonlinear relationship competition parameters γ12 and γ21 and other parameters p,v1,v2 and v3 respectively. Also, the Transcritical bifurcation analysis of the system with respect to γ12 and γ21 have been done. From the analysis, it can be concluded that the nonlinear relationship coefficients between two species x and y may control the instability of the proposed system. Finally, some numerical simulation results have been presented to study the actual dynamics of the proposed model.}

    abstract = {In this paper, a three species dynamical system is explored. The system consisting of two logistically growing competing species and the third species acts as a predator as well as host. It is predating over second species with Holling type II functional response, while first species is benefited from the third species. In addition, the prey species move into a refuge to avoid high predation. The essential mathematical features of the proposed model are studied in terms of boundedness, persistence, local stability and bifurcation. The existence of transcritical bifurcations have been established about two axial points. It has been observed that survival of all three species may be possible due to commensalism. Numerical simulations have been performed to show the Hopf bifurcation about interior equilibrium point. The existence of period-2 solution is observed. Further, the bifurcations of codimension-2 have also been investigated.}

    abstract = { The general nature of the predator-prey interaction has been depicted as a graph of predator versus prey densities from which conditions for stability of the interaction are predicted. An example of a three-species interaction is also presented. Variations of the graph are introduced, and it is shown that an otherwise unstable interaction may be stabilized by the presence of either an inviolable prey hiding place, or extremely low predation pressure at moderate predator and high prey densities, or another predator-limiting resource. Stability is always conferred when the predator is severely limited at its equilibrium density by one of its resources other than its supply of prey. Predators should tend to be limited at their equilibrium densities by more than one of their resources. When either of the two foregoing situations pertains, regular predator-prey oscillations should not be observable. The stability of the interaction close to equilibrium was found to depend exclusively, in the mathematically-continuous model, upon the slopes of two lines in the graph at equilibrium. Stability can be asymptotic rather than oscillatory in type. An equation for the period of oscillatory interactions is also advanced. The effects of Natural Selection on the isoclines, and thus the stability, is not clear-cut. Selection of the prey tends to stabilize the interaction; the opposite is true for selection on the predator. }

Boundedness and stability criteria are established. Three special cases of the model are analyzed, showing the applicability of the theory, and in certain cases extensions are given. The special cases include Lotka-Volterra (where we are able to give necessary and sufficient conditions for persistence), Lotka-Volterra predation with a carrying capacity at the lowest level, and a mixed Lotka-Volterra and Holling predation (at different levels) with a carrying capacity at the lowest level.}
